<!--This is the psychic game a came up with, I didn't even attempt to do the other one.  At this point I thinks its beyond my abilities at this time.
    I know I could have done better with styling the page, and made it more "nicer" looking.  One issue I couldn't figure out is how to reset the game
    after someone inputs a number.  Please let me know your thoughts-->
